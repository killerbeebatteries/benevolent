IRC Bot

An attempt at learning Golang and creating an IRC bot that can idle with the best of us.

# TODO

- ~~tell us about the weather~~
- save a message and send it to another user when they join the chat
- save interesting urls
- ~~use a secure connection~~
- giphy and or tenor integration (interesting to see if there are IRC clients that support loading images)
